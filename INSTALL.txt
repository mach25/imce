imce.module installation instructions

1) Copy imce directory to your modules directory
2) Enable the module at: admin/build/modules
3) Assign permissions to user roles at: admin/user/access
4) Configure the module settings at: admin/settings/imce
5) Start using imce by clicking the browse button in image or link popup of tinymce or fckeditor.
If you configure imce to work with plain textareas there should appear a link under the specified textareas.
You can also reach IMCE from your account page.

Common issues to pay attention:
- Make sure you have the closure variable in your theme file. It contains the html that activates browse button 
for WYSIWYG editors. For phptemplate based themes, closure is $closure inside page.tpl.php.
- Directory paths in settings page must be relative to drupal's file system path that is usually "files".
Therefore, to use the folder "files/foo" just enter "foo".
- If your images disappear after node submission it is probably becouse of your default "input format" not
allowing <img> tag. Select "Full HTML" as default or add <img> tag to allowed tags for your default input format.
- If you are using an ftp-created directory and getting errors, try setting the folder permissions to
chmod 0777 to make sure PHP has full access to it.
